I forked this since it was a fairly heavy rewrite of an existing plugin.
This lets you use JQuery's existing .css() .width() and .height() functions to set css values on an element with or without the "!important" CSS flag.
Without this plugin you couldn't use JQuery to set the attribute if it was currently set with the "!important" flag,
and you can't use JQuery to add the flag to any attribute.
